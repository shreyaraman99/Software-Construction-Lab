Homework: Verifying and publishing a backported change

2. I checked out version 3.0 and switched into the new branch
$ cd diffutils
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. I applied the change 
$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c


4. I learned that C-x 4 a adds a new entry to the change log file

5. $ emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt
C-x 4 a


I used emacs to add ChangeLog onto all the files with proper comments

6. I commit the changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -F Changelog

7. Generate formatted patch
$ git format-patch -1 —-stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. Apply partner’s patch to working directory
My partner is Shirly Fang and her UID is 804938473
$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
$ git am < partner-patch.txt
$ ./bootstrap
$ patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
$ ./configure
$ make

I made sure everything was successful with
$ ./src/diff . -
$ ./src/diff --

$ make check

9. Verify that the ChangeLog entry works
$ make distdir

10.
$ ssh -Y kamu@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk

I found the newest merge on 01/25/2015
