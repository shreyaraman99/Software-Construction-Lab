Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

1. I typed 'wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz' to grab
the source code. Then I typed
'wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig'
to get the signature and
'wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg’
to get the GNU keyring. I unzipped the file by typing
'tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz'.
I verified the signature and GNU keyring by typing
'gpg -—verify —-keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig'.
I got the following errors:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from “Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>”
gpg:                 aka “Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>”
gpg:		     aka “Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>”
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg: 	      There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

I got these errors because the signature does not belong to the owner of
the file

2. I then created my own directory by typing
'mkdir coreIns'
and installed Coreutils into this directory by typing
'cd coreutils-8.29' and './configure —-prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/kamu/coreIns'.
Then I compiled the file with ‘make' and installed it with ‘make install’.

3. To reproduce the bug on my machine, I typed
‘cd coreIns’ and ‘ls -a -A’.
The output was ‘. ..’ followed by all the existing files. This is the error I
expected to see. The -A should have hidden the ‘. ..’, but it did not.

4. To apply the patch, I created a file called file_patch by doing
‘vim patch_file’.
I pasted the contents of Bug #30963 Message #10 into patch_file. I then typed
‘patch -p1 < patch_file’
to apply the patch to the coreutils files.

5. I then typed ‘make’ to rebuild the program so that it has the patch.

6. To test I typed ‘cd coreIns’ to get into the correct directory. I then did
‘ls -a -A’.
The output was as expected, all the files were outputted and the ‘. ..’ was
not shown.
