Q1: This patch improves the performance of ls. It allows for -A to overwrite
the -a flag when called as ls -a -A. It also removes an if statement from the
source code of ls, which means it will run slightly faster.


Q2: The user of Coreutils may not intend for -A to override -a, so the patch
actually doesn’t align with the intentions of the user.


Q3: When the script is invoked on an empty file, we get errors:
Tracebakc (most recent call last):
File “./randline.py”, line 70, in <module> 
 main()
File “./randline.py”, line 64, in main 
 sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
File “./randline.py”, line 34, in choose lines
 return random.choice(self.lines)
File “/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py” line 274, in choice
 return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] # raises IndexError if seq is empty
    IndexError: list index out of range 

We get these errors because the script expects a value to be inputted, but the
there is no input because of the empty file.


Q4: When the script is invoked with Python 3, the following happens:
File “landline.py”, line 65
 except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                   ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This error occurs because Python 3 doesn’t allow automatic tuple unpacking. To
fix this, we would have to pass in a single argument.
