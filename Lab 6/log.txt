$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

I ran this command to check the version
$ sort —-version
The terminal tells me that I have version 8.30

To create 16777216 single-precision floating points numbers, I did 
$ od -An -f -N $(((2**24)*4)) < /dev/urandom | tr -s ‘ ‘ ‘\n’ > float.txt
I did this because one single-precision flop takes 4 bytes and we want 16777216 of them.

I used this following to check
$ wc -l float.txt
There was an extra newline character at the beginning so I deleted it and rechecked
$ emacs float.txt

Sort directly
$ time -p sort -g float.txt > /dev/null
real   37.59
user   194.84
sys    2.59	


1 thread
$ time -p sort -g —-parallel=1 float.txt > /dev/null
real   177.78
user   177.42
sys    0.34


2 threads
$ time -p sort -g —-parallel=2 float.txt > /dev/null
real   95.39
user   181.01
sys    0.57


4 threads
$ time -p sort -g —-parallel=4 float.txt > /dev/null
real   54.89
user   184.29
sys    0.81


8 threads
$ time -p sort -g —-parallel=8 float.txt > /dev/null
real   34.93
user   192.74
sys    1.09

As we increase the number of threads, the ‘real’ time decreases rapidly while ‘sys’ time and ‘user’ times slightly increase. It is likely that the sys time increases because the more threads there 
are, the more sys calls they make. The first default times are similar to the times for 8 threads, so I think the default likely runs with 8 threads.
